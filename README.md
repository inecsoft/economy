__Market:__ profit test  
__Rent-seeking:__ Rent/Subsidy test  

More Profit? Hire engineers  
More Rent-seeking? Hire lawyers and lobbyists  

Profit are produced, as a result of making products people wan to buy, and doing it at a cost less than the value people place on the product. It is the rewards for creating value.

Rent are extracted, by manipulating terms of trade or creating an artificial prize. Energy, time, and resources dissipated in pursuit of rent(s).

Rent-Extraction is manipulating rules, or physical environment, to facilitate collection of rents.

### __Market vs State__

* __Markets:__ Institutions for reducing transactions cost of impersonal exchange.
* __States:__ Institutions with monopoly on legistimate use of force.
* __Division of labor:__ both markets and states organize division of labor, though in different and higly productive ways.

States orgianize "protected" territories with laws.
Markets orginaze excahnge among/within states.

### __Profit vs Rent-Seeking__

* Both state orgs and market can encourage either profits or rent-seeking.
* Profits (the argument for capitalisim)
* Rent-seeking (host economic power distorts capitalism, and political power distorts economic initiative).
* Ret-extraction (the corrupt parctice of changing the rules, or using harm ot thereathen others who create value or have wealth)
 
### __Politics...Median at Best__

* Your imaginary "State".
* The way politics is designed to work:
the median voter
* The way politics atually works...

### __Opportunity cost__

* The value of anything, or the cost of any action, is what is given up.

Productivity up (more products from less workers) - Employment down
Markets serves consummers. product vs price.
Economies destroys jobs.

### __Money, Bancking & Public Finance__

* Direct Exchange
  - The "Double coincience of wants".
  - High transsactions Costs & Inecffiencies.
  - Prices as Exchage Ratios
  
* Indirect Exchange
  - Less costly, more Efficient
  - Money the "Middle Man"
  - Money Price and Mental Economy

* The Political Economy of Money
   * Purcansing Power(PP)
      - Infaltion: a decrease in the PP of money; prices; cost of living goes up.
      - Defaltion: and increase in the PP power of money prices, cost of living goes down.
      - Devaluation and Debasement:  Official and inmediate reductions in PP.

   * Theories of Money & Purchasing Power (PP)
      - The Conventional Theory of Money.
      - The State Theory of Money.
      - The Quatliy theory of Money.
      - The Quantity Theory of Money.
         M * V = P * T
        
        - M = Money supply
        - V = Velocity(reciprocal of money demand)
        - P = Price level
        - T = Economic Growth

### __Big problem, Choose from among Imperfect Solutions__

   * We need other people to do things for us. Lots of people, logs of things, even if we just want a sandwich or a pencil.
   * King? Pretty good to be king, but not serf
   * State? Can't do it. No information, bad incentives. Amounts to a king
   * Markets? Lots of problems, and inequality. But fewer problems that if state does it, and less inequality thatn if King does it.
   * So the argument is not that markets are perfect, but rather that states and Kings are even worse. State don't have the information guiven by prices, and king...well, Kings are Kings. Not very egualitarian.

Currency: Unit of account, store of value, medium of exchange. Any currency has a mix of transactions and speculative motives for "demand".

Money: A system of clearing transactions. Trust, transport, and transaction.

### __Crypto corrency solves__
   * No need to develop banks, property systems, independent judiciary.
   * breaks monopoly of governments and large financial intermediaries, especially banks and credit card companies(visa and mastercard).
   * Not just currency, but an entire system for clearing transactions:
     - trusless proof
     - decentralized 
     - blockchanin ledger
     - impossible to counterfeit or cheat

#### __It is inmoral for me to use something that someone values more. It is a mistake.__

   * _Exchange corrects Mistakes_
       - There are two reasons this is important.
       - Exchange corrects "Mistakes" in allocation, Because it moves stuff toward higher valued uses.
       - Exchange makes everyone who exchanges a lot happier.
       - There are two basic origins of exchange, and both are important.
          
          Same stuff, different preferences.  
          Same preferences, diferent stuff.  

Note: this is the origins of exchange. the origins of market is devision of labor and expecialization.

### __Pure Democracy__

* Indeterminacy/Instability leads to chaos and dictatorship.
* Democracyis Inherently abusive and tyrannical, without protections.

### __The two parts of a democratic constitution.__
   1. The limits on what we can decide on collectively.  
   2. The process by which we will decide.  

Note: contitutional republic suppress democracy.


Why do "constitutional republics" solve the problem?
1. Protections against mayority rule, some limits on domain.
2. rule of 2 (because 2 > 3)

President/Congres: First pas the post

PM/Parlianment: Negotiated coalitions, "Goverment" vs "Opposition".

### __Sucessful goverment is protection of the rights of individuals__ 
    1. You need stable constitution.
    2. Independent judiciary.
